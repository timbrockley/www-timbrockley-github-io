<h3>Photographs and Images</h3>
<p>All photograph and image sizes are nominal. The photographer will provide a pleasing colour balance but cannot guarantee exact colour matching. In the case of part mono/part colour images, the colours used will be subject to the photographer&#39;s artistic interpretation and will be deemed to be correct. All photographs supplied by Tim Brockley Photography are produced to high standards using quality materials. However, all photographs will, in time, fade. This is particularly true if they are left in bright sunlight and are not behind glass. Tim Brockley Photography cannot accept any responsibility for this gradual image deterioration. All pictures purchased are presumed to have been received in good condition unless the client notifies Tim Brockley Photography in writing of any discrepancy or error within 14 days of receipt.</p>


<h3>Booking Fee</h3>

<h3>Payment</h3>
<p>The remaining balance is be due in cleared funds 7 days prior to the agreed date(s).</p>


<h3>Cancellation</h3>
<p>If the client cancels previously requested services more than 7 days in advance, a full or partial refund will be considered by the photographer although is not guaranteed.</p>


<h3>Refund Policy</h3>
<p>The photographer will not refund, nor accept the return of/refusal to pay charges for, any technically acceptable photograph supplied either in print or in electronic format. No exception can be made as we cannot be held responsible for individual tastes or exceptions.</p>


<h3>Editing and retouching</h3>
<p>Editing and retouching is available as an optional extra and the final output of any image that is edited or re-touched will be at the photographer&#39;s discretion. As a general rule retouches are only are made for temporary or slight imperfections although this can be discussed this with the client. Due to the involved processing requirements, a professional retouching service may be recommended.</p>


<h3>Amendments to Terms and Conditions</h3>
<p>The photographer reserves the right to amend these Terms and Conditions without prior notice.</p>
